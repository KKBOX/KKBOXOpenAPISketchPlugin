# KKBOX Open API Sketch Plug-in

by KKBOX iOS App Development Department

**KKBOX Open API Sketch Plug-in** brings the power of KKBOX's
[Open/Partner API](https://developer.kkbox.com) to
[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), your favorite design tool.

The plug-in helps you to import frequent used design materials for
designers at KKBOX, such as metadata and images for songs, albums,
artists and playlists, without leaving Sketch.

The plug-in saves your time while doing a new app/web layout design,
since you do not need to open a web browser to visit KKBOX's web site
to collect these materials.

## Requirement

A Mac computer with Sketch installed. The plugin is developed and
tested on Sketch 47. You need a valid license in order to use Sketch
as well.

## Installation

the plug-in will be installed automatically if you have Sketch
