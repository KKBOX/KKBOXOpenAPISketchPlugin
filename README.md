# KKBOX Open API Sketch Plug-in

by KKBOX iOS App Development Department

**KKBOX Open API Sketch Plug-in** brings the power of KKBOX's
Open/Partner API to [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), your
favorite design tool.

The plug-in helps you to import frequent used design materials for
designers at KKBOX, such as metadata and images for songs, albums,
artists and playlists, without leaving Sketch.

The plug-in saves your time while doing a new app/web layout design,
since you do not need to open a web browser to visit KKBOX's web site
to collect these materials.

## Requirement

A Mac computer with Sketch 3 or above installed. You need a valid
license in order to use Sketch as well.

## Installation

Please follow the instruction to install the software.

### Direct Download

You can [download](https://gitlab.kkinternal.com/kkbox-ios/KKBOXOpenAPISketchPlugin/repository/archive.zip?ref=master)
the plug-in directly from KKBOX's gitlab site. Unzip the downloaded
archive, and double-click on `KKBOXOpenAPI.sketchplugin` in Finder,
the plug-in will be installed automatically if you have Sketch
installed.
